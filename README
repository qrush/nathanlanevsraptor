= NATHAN LANE VS A RAPTOR!

For http://barcampboston.org, there was a programming contest. You had to pick 3 items from a board, I chose:

Nathan Lane
"my dignity"
Nerds

I ended up writing a twitter app to stream responses that said "my dignity" and "nerds".

= Why isn't anything changing?

You have to run the stream process to get tweets to come in. Read the instructions!

= INSTALL

Requires Ruby 1.9.2, then run:

  gem install bundler
  bundle (to get gems)
  rackup (to run the web server)
  rake watch (to stream in tweets)
